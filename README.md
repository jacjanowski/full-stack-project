# Gallery of the Globe 
###### By: Jacob Janowski, Husham Alammar

## Database project for UIC
Web app that that allows users to make an account, post pictures of wherever they are, comment on other posts. A simple blog page of photos.

## View Project
Visit the website [here](https://fierce-eyrie-65571.herokuapp.com/) to see the deployed version of our application.

## Getting Started
**_THIS INSTALLATION IS FOR Windows_**. Make sure you have all the necessary frameworks installed when running our application. Before installing, check to see if you have them installed already.
Will be using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

After downloading, run the following commands to confirm:

`node -v`

`npm -v`

Once confirmed, next we go to installing the program. Go ahead and download the _.zip_ file for this repo or just clone this repo.

##### Git Clone

- Create a new directory
- cd C:/Users/user/my_project
- Initialize git: `git init`
- `git clone https://github.com/jacjanowski/480-final.git`


Once downloaded, go to your 'Program Files' and find the directory MongoDB. 

The path should be similar to this:

`Program Files/MongoDB/Server/4.0/bin`

From in here, you will see all of the MongoDB executables in order for our database to be linked to our program.

## Running the Program
1. Go to `Program Files/MongoDB/Server/4.0/bin` and run the following command:
`./mongod`
2. Go into the directory where the _app.js_ file is located from the _.zip_ file. 
Once there, run the following command:
`node app.js`
You will receive a message in console showing 'Gallery of the Globe server is live'. 
3. Go ahead and open a browser and in the URL, type in `localhost:3000`. You should now see the locally deployed version of the program!
4. To view all database information regarding tables, users, posts, comments, etc., go back into `Program Files/MongoDB/Server/4.0/bin` and run the Mongo Shell by typing the command `./mongo`.

## Interacting with Mongo Shell
This is where we use CRUD fundamentals to be able to make changes on our web app via Mongo Shell commands. Here are some instructions to play around with and notice changes you've made:

Within the Mongo Shell (again, that's within the path listed above and then run `./mongo`), let's start by viewing the databases and using one of them.

#### Choose Database

Right after running `./mongo`, run `show databases` and look for the one called 'final'.

Use it by running `use final`.

Next, check out the tables within the program by running `show tables`. Now, let's get into some CRUD commands.

## CRUD Commands

### Create

Create a new post to feature on the home page

-Ex: `db.campgrounds.insert({name: "Dietz's Addition", image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498050108023-c5249f4df085?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1352&q=80", description: "I am a teacher at UIC and I teach various classes. This class project is related to my Database course that I teach. This is quite a good looking project!"})`



### Read 

Read in all of the entries from a particular table. 

`db.[TABLE NAME HERE].find()` ---> Retrieves all entries from table.

- Ex: `db.users.find()`
- Ex: `db.users.find({"username":"sean"})` ---> Find user with the username 'sean'.

### Update

Change the Title from of the campground 'Misty Winds' to 'Upper Penninsula'.

- Ex: `db.campgrounds.update({"name":"Misty Winds"}, {$set :{"name":"Upper Peninsula"}})`

### Delete

Go ahead and create a user by signing up. Now in the Mongo Shell, check if the user is there

- Ex: `db.users.find({"username":"[USERNAME HERE]"})`

Once confirmed that you have created the user, go ahead and delete them by doing the following:

- Ex: `db.users.remove({"username":"[USERNAME HERE]"})`
